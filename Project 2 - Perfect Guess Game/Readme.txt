**Number Guessing Game:**

A Python game that combines probabilistic logic and user behavior tracking to create an interactive
guessing challenge. Uses randomized data generation and dynamic feedback to guide players toward the
correct number (1-100). Demonstrates data-driven decision-making and input validation.

**Libraries Used:**

- **random** → Generates the target number and selects randomized hint messages for engagement.

**Key Features:**

-> **Tracks and displays** guess history (data persistence)
-> **Adaptive hints** (higher/lower prompts with fun variations)
-> **Performance tiers** (≤3 guesses = "Legend" status)
-> **Robust error handling** (invalid inputs, out-of-range checks)

**Why This Works for My Portfolio:**

-> **Relevant to Data Analysis** – Highlights data generation, tracking, and pattern recognition.
-> **Engagement Metrics** – The "Legend" tier subtly nods to performance analytics.
-> **Clean + Technical** – No fluff, just skills.

**Shorter Alternative:**

"Python game using random to generate a target number. Tracks guesses, analyzes trends (higher/lower),
and rewards efficient problem-solving. Data meets gameplay!"
