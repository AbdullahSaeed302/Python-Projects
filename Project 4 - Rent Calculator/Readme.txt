**Shared Expense Calculator:**

A Python utility that **automates cost-splitting** for shared living spaces. Calculates per-person
contributions for rent, food, and electricity with dynamic unit pricing. Demonstrates
**data aggregation** and **fair-division logic**.

**Libraries Used:**

- **time** â†’ Adds delays for better user experience.  

**Key Features:**

-> **Input-Driven Calculations**: Combines rent, food costs, and variable electricity bills.  
-> **Unit-Price Flexibility**: Adjusts for different electricity tariffs.  
-> **Transparent Output**: Clearly breaks down per-person dues.  

**Technical Highlights:**

-> **Integer Math**: Uses floor division (`//`) for practical rupee splits.
