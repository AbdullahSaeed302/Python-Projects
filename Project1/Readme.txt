**Rock-Paper-Scissors Simulator:**

A Python game using randomized data and conditional logic to simulate the classic duel. Maps user
inputs (r/p/s) to numerical choices (-1, 0, 1) for clean win/loss/draw outcomes. Demonstrates core
programming + data handling.

**Libraries Used:**

- **random** → Generates unpredictable computer choices (fair play!).

**Key Skills:**

-> **Logic-driven** decision trees
-> **Data translation** (user input → game rules)
-> **Input validation** + **loop control**

---

**Why this works for My Portfolio:**

-> **Brief but complete – Libraries + logic explained in 1 line each.
-> **Data-analyst flavor – Highlights "translation" and "validation" (your niche!).
-> **Scannable** – Bullets make it skimmable for recruiters.

**Need even shorter? Could trim to:**

"Python game using random for AI moves. Cleverly maps inputs (r/p/s) to (-1,0,1) for crisp logic.
Try beating the odds!"
