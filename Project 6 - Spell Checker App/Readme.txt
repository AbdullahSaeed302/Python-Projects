**🔍 Spell Checker 4.0**

A Python CLI tool that **detects and corrects spelling errors** with customizable ignore lists and
real-time suggestions. Built for precision and user control.  

**Libraries Used:**

- **spellchecker** → Core spelling correction engine.  
- **termcolor** → Color-coded UI for better readability.  
- **time** → Adds delays for smooth user experience.  

**Key Features:**
 
-> **Context-Aware Corrections**: Preserves original word casing (e.g., "Python" → "Pythn" → "Python").
-> **Dynamic Ignore List**: Lets users add/view/remove words (`ignore_words` set).  
-> **Suggestions Engine**: Offers multiple candidate words for misspellings.  
-> **User-Friendly CLI**: Color-highlighted outputs and intuitive menus.  

**Why It Stands Out:**

-> **Data Analyst Angle**: Logs ignored words for user behavior analysis (potential extension).  
-> **Scalable**: Could integrate with APIs (e.g., Grammarly) for advanced checks.
