**TempTracker Weather App:**

A Python CLI tool that fetches real-time weather data using API calls, processes JSON responses,
and delivers vocalized outputs. Demonstrates **API integration, data parsing, and error handling**
with a user-friendly interface.

**Libraries Used:**  

- **requests** → Handles HTTP requests to fetch live weather data.  
- **json** → Parses API responses into readable dictionaries.  
- **pyttsx3** → Converts text to speech for accessibility.  
- **time** → Adds delays for better user experience.  

**Key Features:** 
 
-> **Real-time data fetching** (temperature in °C via WeatherAPI).  
-> **Voice feedback** for accessibility and engagement.  
-> **Error handling** for invalid city names.  
-> **Loop functionality** for continuous use.

**Why This Works for My Portfolio:**

-> **Data Pipeline Focus** – Highlights ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) via API → JSON → User Output.  
-> **Analytical Angle** – Could extend to log historical data for trend analysis.  
-> **Clean & Impactful** – Shows technical skills without jargon overload.
